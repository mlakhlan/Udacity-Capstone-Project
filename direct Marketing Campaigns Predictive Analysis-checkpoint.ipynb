    "Over the time period business need changes.so the way of doing business. In product/service companies like bank, insurance companies collected huge amount of data over the period and now utilizing this customer's information/data these companies are trying to predict the best way to reach out/communicates/connects with their customers directly based on their interest information. This kind of marketing strategies is known as Direct/Targeted Marketing.\n",

    "For this project design we will be using Bank Marketing Campaign data files.(Taken from UCI machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing?package=regsel&version=0.2.).  This Data set is donated by \"[Moro et al., 2014] S. Moro, P. Cortez and P. Rita. A Data-Driven Approach to Predict the Success of Bank Telemarketing. Decision Support Systems, Elsevier, 62:22-31, June 2014\" '. The ‘Full Bank Data_csv' is uploaded to this folder. We will be designing a model algorithm to predict customer's behavior or response to the Marketing Campaign, based on customer's information the bank has collected over the time period. This can be done by predicting the target response variables based on the all the input variable provided.\n",

There are columns with more than one values like 'marital' we saw in above visualization as well, these columns we will be putting into categorical variables. For these kind of columns better wecreate many create many columns eg. marital_single,marital_devorced,etc and then  assign value ot '1' and '0'.

But when I start evaluating the Model for first time, I got \"ValueError: Input contains NaN, infinity or a value too large for dtype('float64').

    "## 3) Model Evaluation Algorithm:\n",
    "The simplest method that we can use to evaluate the performance of a machine learning algorithm is to use different training and testing datasets.\n",
    "We can take our original cleaned and processed dataset, split it into two parts. Train the algorithm on the first part, make predictions on the second part and evaluate the predictions against the expected results.\n",
    "The size of the split can depend on the size and specifics of your dataset, although it is common to use 70% of the data for training and the remaining 30% for testing.\n",
    "This algorithm evaluation technique is very fast. It is ideal for large datasets (millions of records) where there is strong evidence that both splits of the data are representative of the underlying problem. Because of the speed, it is useful to use this approach when the algorithm you are investigating is slow to train.\n",
    "A downside of this technique is that it can have a high variance. This means that differences in the training and test dataset can result in meaningful differences in the estimate of accuracy.\n",

    "Now we have trained all 7 model algorithms on training data set and we have their accuracy estimates. Now We need to compare the models to each other and select the most accurate. The output of above code cell shows XGB being the winner with highest estimated accuracy score of 91.568%.\n",

    "Cross validation is an approach that you can use to estimate the performance of a machine learning algorithm with less variance than a single train-test set split.\n",
    "\n",
    "It works by splitting the dataset into k-parts (e.g. k=5 or k=10). Each split of the data is called a fold. The algorithm is trained on k-1 folds with one held back and tested on the held back fold. This is repeated so that each fold of the dataset is given a chance to be the held back test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "After running cross validation you end up with k different performance scores that you can summarize using a mean and a standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is a more reliable estimate of the performance of the algorithm on new data given your test data. It is more accurate because the algorithm is trained and evaluated multiple times on different data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of k must allow the size of each test partition to be large enough to be a reasonable sample of the problem, whilst allowing enough repetitions of the train-test evaluation of the algorithm to provide a fair estimate of the algorithms performance on unseen data. For modest sized datasets in the thousands or tens of thousands of records, k values of 3, 5 and 10 are common.\n",
